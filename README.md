* **Favorites System:** Save your preferred stations with one click (★) for quick access.
* **Interactive Metadata Toasts:** See the currently playing song in an elegant, custom notification corner-popup. Click the ⛔ button on the toast to permanently blacklist annoying words (like "AD" or "News").

* **Highly Customizable:** ModMenu integration allows you to tweak volume, disable toasts, and manage your blacklist.
